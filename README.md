What is payroll software?
Payroll software is an on-premises or cloud-based solution that manages, maintains, and automates payments to employees. Robust, integrated, and properly configured payroll software can help organizations of all sizes maintain compliance with tax laws and other financial regulations, and reduce costs. This frees human resources (HR) teams from routine tasks so that they can spend more time on planning, budgeting, and other business-forward initiatives.
